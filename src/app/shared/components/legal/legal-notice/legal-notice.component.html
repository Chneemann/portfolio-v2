    <h3>Disclaimer:</h3>

    <h4>Liability for content</h4>

    <p>
      The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. However, we
      cannot assume any liability for the accuracy, completeness, and topicality
      of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
      content on these pages in accordance with § 7 para. 1 TMG (German
      Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we
      as a service provider are not obliged to monitor transmitted or stored
      third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate
      illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information in
      accordance with general legislation remain unaffected by this. However,
      liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a
      specific infringement. As soon as we become aware of such infringements,
      we will remove this content immediately.
    </p>

    <h4>Liability for links</h4>

    <p>
      Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose
      content we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability
      for this third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the
      pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The
      linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
      linking. Illegal content was not recognizable at the time of linking.
      However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not
      reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. If we become
      aware of any legal infringements, we will remove such links immediately.
    </p>

    <h4>Copyright</h4>

    <p>
      The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are
      subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution,
      and any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the
      copyright law shall require the prior written consent of its respective
      author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted
      for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was
      not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are
      respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such.
      Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please
      inform us accordingly. If we become aware of any infringements, we will
      remove such content immediately.
    </p>

    <h4>Data protection</h4>

    <p>
      The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal
      data. Insofar as personal data (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is
      collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far as
      possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your
      express consent. We would like to point out that data transmission over
      the Internet (e.g. when communicating by e-mail) may be subject to
      security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data against access by
      third parties is not possible, and we hereby expressly prohibit the use of
      contact data published in the context of the legal notice obligation by
      third parties for sending unsolicited advertising and information
      material. The operators of this website expressly reserve the right to
      take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
      information, such as spam e-mails.
